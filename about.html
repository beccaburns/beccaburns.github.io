      <h1>A little bit about me.</h1>
      <p>I am an American citizen living in Stockholm.</p>
      <p>Within the last 6 years, I developed skills in marketing and sales, and I have a passion for supporting entrepreneurs as they pusue their dreams and business ventures.</p>
      <p>I joined Craft Academy with the vision to develop technical skills that provide additional value to future employers and someday, my own business venture!</p>    
      <p>Some of my favorite things include running to explore new cities, skiing with my boyfriend and discovering new cafes and restaurants in Stockholm.</p>
