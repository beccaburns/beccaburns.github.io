      <h1>A little bit about me.</h1>
      <p>I am an American citizen living in Stockholm.</p>
      <h2>Stockholm Bound.</h2>
      <p>I moved to Stockholm to join my boyfriend who is currently working here. 
          Neither of us are from Stockholm, but we absolutely love this city!</p>
      <p>After some research, I realize that Stockholm is becoming a hub for tech startups. 
          My background is in marketing and sales so, I decided to join Craft Academy with 
          the objective to develop technical skills that provide additional value to future 
          employers and someday, my own business venture!</p> 
      <h2>Things I Love.</h2>
          <p>Some of my favorite things include running to explore new cities, skiing with my boyfriend and discovering new cafes and restaurants in Stockholm.</p>
